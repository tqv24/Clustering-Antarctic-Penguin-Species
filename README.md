# Arctic Penguin Exploration

## Overview
Arctic Penguin Exploration is a data science project focused on unraveling clusters in the icy domain of Antarctica using K-means clustering. The primary goal is to help identify groups among penguins based on various physical characteristics.

## Data Source
The dataset used in this project was collected and made available by Dr. Kristen Gorman and the Palmer Station, Antarctica LTER, a member of the Long Term Ecological Research Network. The dataset includes information on penguin culmen length, culmen depth, flipper length, body mass, and sex.

## Project Structure
- `data/`: Directory containing the dataset (`penguins.csv`).
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter Notebooks for data exploration, preprocessing, and clustering.
- `scripts/`: Python scripts for utility functions and data preprocessing.
- `results/`: Directory to store the results of the clustering analysis.
- `README.md`: Project overview, setup instructions, and usage guidelines.
